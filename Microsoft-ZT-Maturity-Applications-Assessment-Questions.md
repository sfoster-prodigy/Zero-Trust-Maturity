    - Initial: Initial steps have been taken to adopt Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps for a subset of applications and services, starting the process of centralizing visibility and enhancing governance and usage optimization. While this phase indicates the beginning of leveraging Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, comprehensive integration across all applications and the full utilization of its capabilities may still be under development.
      - Indicators: 
        - Partial adoption of Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, with integration efforts focusing on critical applications or services.
        - Initial improvements in visibility into app activities and data, though a holistic view across all applications is not yet achieved.
        - Some enhancement in governance actions and usage optimization for integrated apps, but with room for expansion and deeper utilization of Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps features.

    - Advanced: A significant number of applications and services are integrated with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, markedly improving visibility, governance, and usage optimization. This advanced tier reflects a mature approach to application security management, with comprehensive monitoring and control mechanisms in place, though some areas may still require attention for full capability utilization.
      - Indicators: 
        - Broad integration of applications and services with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, facilitating enhanced visibility and governance.
        - Advanced utilization of governance actions and usage optimization features, contributing to more effective and efficient application security management.
        - Significant reduction in security risks and governance gaps, supported by detailed insights into application activities and optimized app usage practices.

    - Optimal: Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is fully adopted and integrated across all applications and services, achieving the highest level of application security management, visibility, and governance. This optimal scenario ensures comprehensive monitoring and control over application activities, data security, and usage optimization, leveraging the full suite of capabilities offered by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.
      - Indicators: 
        - Universal and strategic adoption of Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps across the entire application landscape, ensuring no gaps in visibility or governance.
        - Full realization of the benefits provided by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, including operational efficiencies, enhanced security posture, and optimized application usage.
        - Proactive and comprehensive management of application-related security and governance, underpinned by deep insights and advanced control mechanisms, significantly enhancing the organization's security posture and operational effectiveness.

### Discover and control the use of shadow IT

#### Integrate Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
  - Is Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps integrated with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for cloud traffic analysis on Windows 10 and later devices?
    - Legacy: There is no integration between Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for analyzing cloud traffic on Windows 10 and later devices. Organizations may rely on separate, uncoordinated security solutions that lead to gaps in visibility and control over cloud application usage, increasing the risk of shadow IT.
      - Indicators:
        - Absence of coordinated cloud traffic analysis, leading to incomplete visibility into application usage and potential security risks.
        - Increased vulnerability to unauthorized cloud services and applications due to the lack of integrated monitoring and control mechanisms.
        - Challenges in identifying and mitigating shadow IT, impacting the organizationâ€™s overall security posture and compliance status.

    - Initial: Initial efforts have been made to integrate Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for cloud traffic analysis on some Windows 10 and later devices. This phase marks the beginning of a more unified approach to monitoring and controlling cloud application usage, though comprehensive integration and full utilization of this synergy may still be developing.
      - Indicators: 
        - Partial integration for cloud traffic analysis, covering a select group of devices or specific departments.
        - Initial improvements in detecting unauthorized cloud application usage, but a unified view across the entire device fleet is not yet achieved.
        - Some enhancement in the organization's ability to manage cloud application risks, with room for improvement in achieving widespread integration and effective shadow IT control.

    - Advanced: A significant number of Windows 10 and later devices are integrated with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for comprehensive cloud traffic analysis. This advanced tier reflects a mature approach to cloud application security management, with extensive monitoring and control over cloud app usage, significantly reducing the risks associated with shadow IT.
      - Indicators: 
        - Broad adoption of integration between Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, facilitating enhanced visibility and governance of cloud application usage.
        - Advanced utilization of cloud traffic analysis capabilities, enabling effective detection, investigation, and mitigation of unauthorized app usage.
        - Noticeable reduction in shadow IT risks, supported by comprehensive monitoring, automated alerts, and proactive governance actions facilitated by the integrated security solution.

    - Optimal: Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is fully integrated with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint across all Windows 10 and later devices, achieving the highest level of cloud application usage analysis and shadow IT control. This optimal scenario ensures comprehensive visibility into cloud traffic, enabling consistent application of security policies, real-time detection of unauthorized app usage, and effective mitigation of associated risks.
      - Indicators: 
        - Universal and strategic integration of cloud traffic analysis capabilities across the entire Windows device fleet, eliminating gaps in cloud application usage visibility.
        - Full realization of operational efficiencies and security enhancements offered by the integrated solution, including optimized cloud application governance and effective shadow IT mitigation.
        - Proactive and comprehensive management of cloud application security risks, underpinned by deep insights, real-time monitoring, and advanced control mechanisms, significantly enhancing the organization's ability to safeguard its cloud application ecosystem effectively.
