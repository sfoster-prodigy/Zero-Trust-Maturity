### Discontinue legacy network security technology
#### Moving Beyond Legacy NIDS/NIPS in Cloud Environments

**Has the organization moved beyond the use of legacy Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS), considering the major cloud service providers' capabilities to filter common network layer attacks and the limitations of signature-based detection methods?**

- **Legacy:** The organization predominantly relies on traditional NIDS/NIPS for network security, without fully leveraging the advanced security features offered by major cloud service providers. This reliance on legacy systems may lead to gaps in security coverage due to the limitations of signature-based detection and the evolving nature of cyber threats.
    - Indicators: 
          - Continued use of legacy NIDS/NIPS without significant integration of cloud-native security services.
          - Potential vulnerabilities due to the limitations of signature-based detection in addressing zero-day attacks and advanced persistent threats (APTs).
          - Challenges in effectively managing network security within a cloud-centric environment, potentially leading to inefficiencies and reduced detection capabilities.

- **Initial:** Initial steps have been taken to explore and partially integrate cloud-native security solutions offered by cloud service providers, alongside existing legacy NIDS/NIPS. While this phase marks the beginning of the transition to more modern security approaches, comprehensive adoption and optimization of cloud-native security features may still be under development.

#### The Diminishing Effectiveness of Network-Based DLP and the Shift Away from SSL-Bridging

**Has the organization recognized the decreasing effectiveness of network-based Data Loss Prevention (DLP) due to network-level encryption and moved away from relying on SSL-bridging techniques, while exploring alternative security measures for data protection in the cloud environment?**


- **Legacy:** The organization primarily relies on traditional network-based DLP solutions, including SSL-bridging techniques, for data protection. This reliance may result in decreased effectiveness in identifying and preventing data loss due to the increasing use of end-to-end encryption, which obscures data content at the network layer.
