**Has the organization partitioned applications into different Azure Virtual Networks (VNets), creating dedicated virtual networks for various applications or application components?**
- **Legacy:** The organization has not adopted network segmentation strategies using Azure Virtual Networks (VNets), leading to a flat network topology that could increase the risk of lateral movement in the event of a compromise. This absence of segmentation may result in less effective isolation of application components, potentially exposing sensitive applications to unnecessary risk.
