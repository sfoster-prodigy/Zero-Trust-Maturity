### Enable Conditional Access integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

**Is Conditional Access integrated with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps?**

- Legacy: Conditional Access is not integrated with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, leaving the organization's cloud applications and data exposed to potential security risks. There's no systematic approach to monitor or control access based on the evolving threat landscape, resulting in a static and vulnerable security posture. Without this integration, the organization misses out on advanced security analytics and real-time threat detection, making it difficult to enforce adaptive access policies that respond to assessed risks.
    - Indicators Assessors should evaluate the client environment against these indicators to determine the current tier of implementation and identify areas for improvement towards achieving an optimal security posture.
        - Absence of Conditional Access policies informed by threat intelligence.
        - No evidence of adaptive security measures based on user behavior and risk assessment.
        - Increased incidents of security breaches due to unmonitored application access.
- Initial: Initial steps are taken to integrate Conditional Access with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, providing a basic level of security monitoring and response capabilities. At this stage, Conditional Access policies begin to leverage some signals from Defender for Cloud Apps to inform access decisions, but the implementation is limited and does not fully utilize the potential of cloud-based threat intelligence. The organization starts to see benefits in terms of improved visibility into access patterns and potential threats, but the coverage is not comprehensive.
    - Indicators Assessors should evaluate the client environment against these indicators to determine the current tier of implementation and identify areas for improvement towards achieving an optimal security posture.

### Enable restricted session for use in access decisions

**Is restricted session enabled for limited access to SharePoint Online and Exchange Online?**

- There are no restrictions on accessing SharePoint Online and Exchange Online from unmanaged devices, allowing full access without any conditional access policies in place. This unrestricted access enables users to download, print, and sync files freely, significantly increasing the risk of data leakage and unauthorized access to sensitive organizational information.
    - Indicators Assessors should evaluate the client environment against these indicators to determine the current tier of implementation and identify areas for improvement towards achieving an optimal security posture.
        - Full access from any device without restrictions
        - No conditional access policies implemented
        - High risk of data leakage and unauthorized access

- Initial: Basic limitations are introduced for access from unmanaged devices. In SharePoint Online, access is restricted to browser-only, disabling the ability to download, print, or sync files. Similarly, in Exchange Online, conditional access policies restrict the ability to download email attachments to local machines, although users can still view and edit attachments in the browser. This tier introduces a fundamental level of security but lacks comprehensive controls and granularity in access restrictions.
    - Indicators Assessors should evaluate the client environment against these indicators to determine the current tier of implementation and identify areas for improvement towards achieving an optimal security posture.
        - Browser-only access for SharePoint Online
        - Download restrictions for email attachments in Exchange Online
        - Basic level of security with limited granularity

- Advanced: More sophisticated conditional access policies are implemented. SharePoint Online administrators can now tailor access based on specific user groups, site classifications, or content types, and use PowerShell for detailed policy application. Exchange Online enhances security by allowing finer adjustments to the OwaMailboxPolicy, such as setting attachments to read-only or entirely blocking downloads on non-compliant devices. This tier offers improved security through enhanced control over access and editing capabilities, although some exceptions for specific user needs or applications may remain.
    - Indicators Assessors should evaluate the client environment against these indicators to determine the current tier of implementation and identify areas for improvement towards achieving an optimal security posture.
        - Granular access control based on user groups, site classifications, or content types
        - Use of PowerShell for detailed policy application in SharePoint Online
        - Enhanced security measures for attachments in Exchange Online
        - Improved control with allowances for exceptions

- Optimal: A holistic approach to managing access from unmanaged devices is adopted, applying comprehensive conditional access policies across all Microsoft 365 services. This includes enforcing strict access controls based on device compliance, user risk profiles, and session restrictions, ensuring a seamless yet secure experience for users across all devices. SharePoint Online and Exchange Online benefit from integrated policies that not only restrict access and editing based on device status but also enforce these policies consistently across the entire suite of Microsoft 365 applications. This tier represents the highest level of security, minimizing data exposure and unauthorized access while maintaining operational flexibility.
    - Indicators Assessors should evaluate the client environment against these indicators to determine the current tier of implementation and identify areas for improvement towards achieving an optimal security posture.
        - Comprehensive conditional access policies across Microsoft 365
        - Enforced access controls based on device compliance and user risk profiles
